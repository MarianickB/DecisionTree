# DecisionTree

Only one file of the entire project has been uploaded since it was the only file coded almost entirely by me. 

In this project, a decision tree was built from scratch. Receiving as an input a dataset, the program creates a decision tree. 
The methods created from scratch are able to
compare the different nodes of the tree (see if theyâ€™re equal or not) and add a node to the tree according to a training test in which
a best-split divides the data into two lists that have the best entropy.

The last two methods were provided and were not coded at all by me. The code has comments to explain what each method does.
